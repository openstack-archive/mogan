Node Aggregates
===============

Node aggregates, like nova's host aggregates for VMs, can be regarded as a mechanism to further partition an availability zone; while availability zones are visible to users, node aggregates are only visible to administrators. Allow administrators to assign key-value pairs to groups of bare metal nodes. Each node can have multiple aggregates, each aggregate can have multiple key-value pairs, and the same key-value pair can be assigned to multiple aggregates. This information can be used in the scheduler to enable advanced scheduling by setting key-value pairs to flavor resource aggregates field.

Admin users can use the :command:`openstack baremetalcompute aggregate` command to create, delete and manage aggregates. To see information for this command, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ openstack baremetalcompute aggregate [TAB]
    add        create     delete     list       list_node  remove     set        show       unset

Availability Zones (AZs)
------------------------

Like Nova, the availability zone is actually a specific metadata attached to
an aggregate. Adding that specific metadata to an aggregate makes the aggregate
visible from an end-user perspective and consequently allows to schedule upon a
specific set of nodes (the ones belonging to the aggregate).

.. note:: One node can be in multiple aggregates, but it can only be in one
  availability zone


Affinity Zones
--------------

The affinity zone is also a specific metadata attached to an aggregate, which
makes server group affinity and anti-affinity happen. You may define it as
failure domains(e.g., by power circuit, rack, room, etc).

.. note:: One node can be in multiple aggregates, but it can only be in one
  affinity zone
