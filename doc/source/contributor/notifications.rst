Versioned notifications in Mogan
================================

The Mogan notifications are events related with changes of resources, and can
be consumed by internal system. Notifications are sent to these services over a
message bus by oslo.messaging's Notifier class [1]_. The notifications
consumer could be a messaging bus listener service, e.g. Ceilometer
notification agent or Searchlight Listener.

Generally, a notification message performed by a json string, which includes
two parts: a set of common info and a notification payload which is a
dictionary that including the information we want to send out. The format as
the following::

    {
        "priority": <string, selected from a predefined list by the sender>,
        "event_type": <string, defined by the sender>,
        "timestamp": <string, the isotime of when the notification emitted>,
        "publisher_id": <string, defined by the sender>,
        "message_id": <uuid, generated by oslo>,
        "payload": <json serialized dict, defined by the sender>
    }

The versioned notification is a concept that defines a base frame for general
notifications class definition. The payload is not a free form dictionary but a
serialized oslo versionedobject [2]_.

Configure to enable notification in Mogan
=========================================

To enable notification in Mogan, you need to configure the ``transport_url``
option under the ``[oslo_messaging_notifications]`` section in Mogan's
configuration file. The ``transport_url`` is the message bus connection url,
for example::

    rabbit://stackrabbit:password@127.0.0.1:5672/

By default, the notifications message will be sent to the message queue named
``versioned_notification.PRIORITY``, the *PRIORITY* depends on the priority
in the notification message.

Add a new notification to Mogan
===============================
The every versioned notification in Mogan is modeled with oslo
versionedobjects. Every versioned notification class inherits from the
`mogan.notifications.objects.base.NotificationBase` which
already defines three mandatory fields of the notification `event_type`,
`publisher_id` and `priority`. The new notification class shall add a new field
`payload` with an appropriate payload type. The payload object of the
notification shall inherit from the
`mogan.notifications.objects.base.NotificationPayloadBase` class and shall
define the fields of the payload as versionedobject fields.

Please note that the notification objects shall not be registered to the
MoganObjectRegistry in order to avoid mixing Mogan internal objects with the
notification objects. Instead of that using the register_notification
decorator on every concrete notification object.

The following code example defines the necessary model classes for a new
notification `myobject.update`::

    @mogan_base.MoganObjectRegistry.register_notification
    class MyObjectNotification(notification.NotificationBase):
        # Version 1.0: Initial version
        VERSION = '1.0'

        fields = {
            'payload': fields.ObjectField('MyObjectUpdatePayload')
        }


    @mogan_base.MoganObjectRegistry.register_notification
    class MyObjectUpdatePayload(notification.NotificationPayloadBase):
        # Version 1.0: Initial version
        VERSION = '1.0'
        fields = {
            'some_data': fields.StringField(),
            'another_data': fields.StringField(),
        }


After that the notification can be populated and emitted with the following
code::

    payload = MyObjectUpdatePayload(some_data="foo", another_data="bar")
    MyObjectNotification(
        publisher=notification.NotificationPublisher.from_service_obj(
            <movan.objects.server.Server instance that emits the notification>),
        event_type=notification.EventType(
            object='myobject',
            action=fields.NotificationAction.UPDATE),
        priority=fields.NotificationPriority.INFO,
        payload=payload).emit(context)

The above code will generate the following notification on the wire::

    {
        "priority":"INFO",
        "payload":{
            "mogan_object.namespace":"mogan",
            "mogan_object.name":"MyObjectUpdatePayload",
            "mogan_object.version":"1.0",
            "mogan_object.data":{
                "some_data":"foo",
                "another_data":"bar",
            }
        },
        "event_type":"myobject.update",
        "publisher_id":"<the name of the service>:<the host where the service runs>"
    }


What should be in the notification payload
==========================================
This is just a guideline. You should always consider the actual use case that
requires the notification.

* Always include the identifier (e.g. uuid) of the entity that can be used to
  query the whole entity over the REST API so that the consumer can get more
  information about the entity.
* You should consider including those fields that are related to the event
  you are sending the notification about. For example if a change of a field of
  the entity triggers an update notification then you should include the field
  to the payload.
* An update notification should contain information about which part of the
  entity is changed. Either by filling the object changes part of the
  payload (note that it is not supported by the notification framework
  currently) or sending both the old state and the new state of the entity in
  the payload.
* You should never include an internal object in the payload. Create a new
  object and use the SCHEMA field to map the internal object to the
  notification payload. In this way the evolution of the internal object model
  can be decoupled from the evolution of the notification payload.
* The delete notification should contain the same information as the create or
  update notifications. This makes it possible for the consumer to listen only
  to the delete notifications but still filter on some fields of the entity
  (e.g. project_id).
