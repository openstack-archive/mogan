===========================================
Welcome to Mogan's developer documentation!
===========================================

Introduction
============

Mogan is an OpenStack project dedicated for bare metal computing management,
which is designed specifically for bare metals, so compared with Nova, we can
provide a more lightweight and convenient platform with more advanced features
by leveraging Ironic. Besides this, we also plan to support RSD, then we can
not only provide Pre-set Configuration Servers, but also Custom Servers.

Site Notes
----------

This site is primarily intended to provide documentation for developers
interested in contributing to or working with mogan. It *also* contains
references and guides for administrators which are not yet hosted elsewhere on
the OpenStack documentation sites.
