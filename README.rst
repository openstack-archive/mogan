Mogan
=====

Mogan is a project dedicated for bare metal computing management, which
is designed specifically for BMs, so we can provide a more lightweight and
convenient platform with more advanced features by leveraging Ironic. Besides
this, we also plan to support RSD(Rack Scale Design), so we can not only
provide Pre-set Configuration Servers but also Custom Servers.
