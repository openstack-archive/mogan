address:
  description: |
    The floating IP address.
  in: body
  required: true
  type: string
availability_zone:
  description: |
    The availability zone from which to launch the instance. When you provision resources,
    you specify from which availability zone you want your instance to be built.  Typically,
    you use availability zones to arrange bare metal nodes into logical groups.
    An availability zone provides a form of physical isolation and redundancy from
    other availability zones. For instance, if some racks in your data center are
    on a separate power source, you can put servers in those racks in their own availability
    zone. Availability zones can also help separate different classes of hardware.  By
    segregating resources into availability zones, you can ensure that your application
    resources are spread across disparate machines to achieve high availability in
    the event of hardware or other failure.
